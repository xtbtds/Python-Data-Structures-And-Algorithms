# Algorithms and Data structures on Python  
This repository was created to help me see my progress in learning. As soon as I learn an algorithm, I try to code it by myself and add here.  
:blue_square: - planned  
:yellow_square: - started, not tested or not completely finished
:white_check_mark: - finished and tested
