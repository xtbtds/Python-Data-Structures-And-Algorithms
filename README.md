# Algorithms and Data structures on Python  
This repository was created to help me see my progress in learning. As soon as I learn an algorithm, I try to code it by myself and add here.  
:blue_square: - planned  
:yellow_square: - started, not tested or not completely finished  
:white_check_mark: - finished and tested

* :white_check_mark: [Depth First Search](https://github.com/xtbtds/Python-Data-Structures-And-Algorithms/blob/main/Graphs/DFS/DFS_stack.py) - O(V+E) time - stack implementation
* :white_check_mark: [Breadth First Search](https://github.com/xtbtds/Python-Data-Structures-And-Algorithms/blob/main/Graphs/BFS/BFS.py) - O(V+E) time - queue implementation
* :blue_square: Prim's Algorithm 
* :blue_square: Kruskal's Algorithm
* :blue_square: Dijkstra Shortest Path
## Mathematics
* :white_check_mark: [Euclidean Algorithm](https://github.com/xtbtds/Python-Data-Structures-And-Algorithms/blob/main/Mathematics/Euclidean_GCD.py) - O(Log max(a, b)) time
## Sortings
* :blue_square: Merge Sort
* :white_check_mark: [Bubble Sort](https://github.com/xtbtds/Python-Data-Structures-And-Algorithms/blob/main/sortings/bubble_sort.py) - O(n^2) time, no additional memory

* :blue_square: Selection Sort
## Other
* :white_check_mark: [Remove Duplicates (sorted)](https://github.com/xtbtds/Python-Data-Structures-And-Algorithms/blob/main/Other/RemoveDuplicates/Remove_Duplicates_Sorted.py) - O(n) time, O(n) memory, O(1) additional memory
* :white_check_mark: [Remove Duplicates (unsorted)](https://github.com/xtbtds/Python-Data-Structures-And-Algorithms/blob/main/Other/RemoveDuplicates/Remove_Duplicates_Unsorted.py) - O(n) time, O(n) memory - map implementation
